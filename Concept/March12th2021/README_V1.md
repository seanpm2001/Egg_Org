# Egg org

Egg Org is a free and open source alternative to Egg inc. Development focus is currently only for Linux, BSD and BSD/Darwin. Windows, and otherOS support coming soon.

## Differences between Egg inc. and Egg org:

2. Almost entirely different game, building on the concept

3. Save files: up to 256 save files per bird type

4. Different farms for other birds (not just chickens) 

5. Graphical modes: skeumorphism by default, flat design optional

6. New news stories

7. Drone control: turn drones off, or have anti-drone rocket launchers (available as a rare special feature)

14. Seventh currency (premium) golden eggs

15. No in-app purchases or advertisements by default, golden eggs and other currency/boosts must be earned manually through gameplay

16. Switch between existing farms, even after prestige

17. Prestige is still present

18. Options for the birds to come out of their coop and wander around

19. You can buy decorations and customize your farm(s) but only a certain amount, or else it will become too similar to other farm games

20. Farm is a bit larger, drones wrap around

21. Seasons on/off, Spring, Summer, Autumn Winter

22. ESync on/off (Earth Sync) the game will have a sunset/sunrise at the same time as the sunset/sunrise in your current location, and also have a night mode and a day mode

23. Icon can be customized

24. More music and sound effects, recorded from real animals

25. Soundboard - Sound player with file location embedded

1. Max in Egg inc: 30 per second, Max in Egg org: 65536 per second (may lag display)

2. More chicken coop upgrades

3. More hatchery upgrades

4. More tiers and tier upgrades
